## Credits

React knowledge from various stacked overflow forums that helped me understand how components work. I have also used https://www.freepik.com to assimulate free asset icons and pictures to use on my portfolio. I also used a tutorial from Code Complete, a youtuber, who makes great guides on how to make things look outstanding.
